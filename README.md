# paraphrase

This is a naive way of paraphrasing sentences by replacing verbs(detected with spaCy) with synonyms when possible(using nltk).

1. python -m venv env

2. activate env ( for Windows, run .\env\Scripts\activate )

3. install requirements: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

4. wordnet and stopwords are already included.
